# 🎵 Music Generation using Deep Learning

This project focuses on generating short sequences of music using deep learning models, particularly inspired by WaveNet architecture. It demonstrates how symbolic music (MIDI format) can be preprocessed, modeled, and synthesized using neural networks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically generate musical melodies with minimal human intervention. It provides a practical implementation of deep learning concepts applied to music theory using classical MIDI datasets. The model learns musical patterns from existing compositions and generates plausible new sequences.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow
- **Music Processing**: Music21
- **Model Type**: Dilated causal convolutional network (WaveNet-inspired)
- **Output**: MIDI file containing generated musical sequence

## 📊 Results

- The model learns musical sequences and generates 20-note outputs.
- The sequences are converted to MIDI and can be played using any MIDI player.
- The model training history (loss curves) is visualized for analysis.

---

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset used consists of MIDI files from Bach’s *Well-Tempered Clavier II*. The symbolic nature of these compositions allows easier modeling of structure and musical grammar. Files are processed using Music21 to extract notes and chords.
